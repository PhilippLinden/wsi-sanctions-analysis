Following the guidelines of [Code and Data](https://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/CodeAndData.xhtml#magicparlabel-270), this directory is dedicated to raw data ONLY. Datasets in this input directory should NEVER be edited. If newer data extracts are used, older raw data should just be replaced and changes commmitted. Constructed datasets should NEVER be placed in this directory.
