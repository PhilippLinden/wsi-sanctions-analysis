# 02prc - Processed data and scripts

### Directories

`/pdta`
:  Processed data

`/scr`
:  Analytical scripts (possibly in subfolders)

---

This directory should contain constructed data files that have been produced by scripts that were run. This includes modifications made to the original raw data by recoding, aggregating, subsetting, and other data cleaning operations. 

It should be possible to delete all of the contents in `/pdta` directory and re-run the scripts used to reproduce the files exactly.
